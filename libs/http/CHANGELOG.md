### Breaking changes

- Dropped support for `rxjs@5`. Consumers can install `rxjs-compat@^6` to support older versions of `rxjs`. [#53](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/53)

# 4.0.0-rc.1 (2020-01-31)

# 4.0.0-rc.0 (2019-11-21)

### Breaking changes:

- Removed `SkyAuthHttp`. Instead, use Angular's `HttpClient` and import the `SkyAuthHttpClientModule` to implement features such as Blackbaud authentication. [#46](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/46)

# 3.9.0 (2019-11-21)

- Added a deprecation message to the `SkyAuthHttp` utility. We will remove `SkyAuthHttp` in the next major version of `@skyux/http` because of a dependency on Angular's `@angular/http` module, which was removed in Angular version 8. We recommend using Angular's `HttpClient` and importing the `SkyAuthHttpClientModule` to implement features such as Blackbaud authentication. [#44](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/44)

# 3.5.0 (2019-07-25)

- Added a feature to allow applications to provide a default permission scope to `SkyAuthInterceptor`. [#32](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/32) (Thanks [@Blackbaud-JasonBodnar](https://github.com/Blackbaud-JasonBodnar)!)

- Added a module for unit testing services that use the auth interceptor. [#19](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/19)
- Added a `skyAuthHttpJsonOptions()` function to enforce a `responseType` of `json`. This ensures that the correct type is inferred when used in conjection with the generic methods on Angular's `HttpClient`. [#20](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/20)

# 3.3.0 (2019-05-07)

- Added methods to `SkyAuthTokenProvider` to get a decoded token. This enables consumers to access properties such as the user's current zone to make requests to the appropriate zone endpoint. [#17](https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux-http/pull/17)
